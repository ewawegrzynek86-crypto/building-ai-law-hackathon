# building-ai-law-hackathon
Building AI course projects &amp; Legal Tech automation challenge. Exploring the bridge between AI models and real-world business value
## 🚀 Upcoming Challenge: AI Consulting Hackathon (Feb 2025)

I am currently preparing for an intensive, 72-hour individual hackathon organized by **Swans**. 

### The Mission:
* **Client:** A law firm struggling with slow internal processes and client churn.
* **Goal:** Diagnose operational bottlenecks and build a working AI-powered automation prototype.
* **Focus:** Bridging the gap between raw AI models and real-world business value.

### My Preparation Roadmap:
1. **Tech Stack:** Exploring automation tools like **Make.com** and **n8n** to connect LLMs with document workflows.
2. **AI Logic:** Applying principles from the *Building AI* course (linear regression for predictions, TF-IDF for document analysis).
3. **Delivery:** Mastering the "Consultant Mindset" – focusing on ROI and efficiency rather than just code.

*Stay tuned for the project submission after March 2nd!*
